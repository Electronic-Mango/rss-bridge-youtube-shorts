# YouTube shorts for RSS-Bridge

Modified [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/tree/master) [YouTube bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/blob/master/bridges/YoutubeBridge.php) responding only with YouTube shorts.

For now only looking up shorts for custom names and channel IDs is working.
Looking up by username should also work, but I haven't tested it.
